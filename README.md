# AndroidYoutubeList1

This Project is a demo program that shows how to configure a simple Youtube client in an Android application.
This program is a resource for a short tutorial series i am making on how to use the Youtbe Data and Android Player API's in an Android app
to search and play videos from youtube.
I am making this tutorial as it is the one i was hoping to find when i undertook this project and so hopefully this
will be of use to others wishing to do the same.

This project is an updated version of a tutorial i found showing how to build the same project in Eclipse. Here is the link to that original tutorial.

  -Displaying the search results in a ListView including thumbnail, video title, and video description 
  
  -upon selecting a video from the listview a new activity will open and play the selected youtube video.
