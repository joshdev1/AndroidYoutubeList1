# AndroidYoutubeList1

This Project is a demo program that shows how to configure a simple Youtube client in an Android application.
This program is a resource for a short tutorial series i am making on how to use the Youtbe Data and Android Player API's in an Android app
to search and play videos from youtube.
I am making this tutorial as it is the one i was hoping to find when i undertook this project and so hopefully this
will be of use to others wishing to tackle the same technologies.

This project builds upon other similar tutorials already out there such as those by CodingWithMitch on how to use 
the Youtube Android Player API to embed videos in an android app. A link to this vdeo is provided below.



#### Brief description of app functionality

  -using user input to Send a search request and reciving/handeling a response using the Youtube Data API
  
  -Displaying the search results in a ListView including thumbnail, video title, and video description 
  
  -upon selecting a video from the listview a new activity will open and play the selected youtube video.

Full disclosure, i have been developing on android for around 9 months and so please point out any mistakes you may see.
I hope to build upon this in the future and improve the program such as adding a recycler view.
